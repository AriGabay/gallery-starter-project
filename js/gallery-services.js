      'In Minesweeper, mines (that resemble naval mines in the classic theme) are scattered throughout a board, which is divided into cells. Cells have three states: uncovered, covered and flagged. A covered cell is blank and clickable, while an uncovered cell is exposed. Flagged cells are those marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location. A player left-clicks a cell to uncover it. If a player uncovers a mined cell, the game ends, as there is only 1 life per game. Otherwise, the uncovered cells displays either a number, indicating the quantity of mines diagonally or orthogonally adjacent to it, or a blank tile (or Zero), and all adjacent non-mined cells will automatically be uncovered. Right-clicking on a cell will flag it, causing a flag to appear on it. Flagged cells are still considered covered, and a player can click on them to uncover them, although typically they must first be unflagged with an additional right-click. The first click in any game will never be a mine. To win the game, players must uncover all non-mine cells, at which point, the timer is stopped. Flagging all the mined cells is not required.Shoe Store Inventory Management Panel',
